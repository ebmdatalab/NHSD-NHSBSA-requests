# NHSD-NHSBSA-requests

This repo describes a process where:

1. NHSD DSA data from Jan 2020 onwards are [obtained](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars/data-uses-register) and saved locally
2. These data are sliced and diced by `tidyverse` to report on who is requesting the 'Medicines Dispenced in Primary Care' dataset.

The report is written using `RMarkdown` and by default generates a PDF.
